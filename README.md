# Project-AMADEUS

Beginner coders are very dependent on AI for debugging and logic building which is a very big concern. So to prevent this (kind of ?) AMADEUS was created.
It helps to keep track on your usage of AI and enables it's users to rely less on AI. 
You might ask "How does AMADEUS do that?", well to answer that lets see how AMADEUS works;

Core Functionality
It is a voice activated coding assitant that when used the trigger word (default: "Command Arise") would copy your code and then try to look for errors and possible fix using the Google Gemini Model.
**It can only copy code through the clipboard.

The Point System
Once the program has been started, it will earn points after a specific interval. These points when reach the maximum threshold will result in a LEVEL UP which will result in some change in the Avatar.
Everytime the trigger word is used some points will be deducted. If enough points are deducted it will lead to a loss of level.
AMADEUS also require a minimum of 500 points for it to work if points decrease below this threshold, it will lead to a freeze. The trigger word will not work unless the minimum threshold is reached again.


**Easter Egg:- The name AMADEUS comes from the show Steins; Gate, specifically Steins; Gate 0.
